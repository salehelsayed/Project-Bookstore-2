Then I want you to make better modifications, I need you to provide guidance for the developer that will be provided as Phase 2.2 in order to :
1- In case the image of the coverpage doesn't exist, we should use a place holder [+]
2- the star ratting of the review is a function that displays the number of starts , so if it's 5 stars all 5 stars should be yellow, if it is 4 stars, then 4 yellow stars and 1 empty star, if the rating has fraction ex, 4.7, then 4 stars yellow and the 5th star is half full with yellow. don't make it static, make a function that should be replicated in all book-cards (if you haven't implemented it yet". [+]
3- the "Download" and "View & Chat" buttons should look better. [+]
4- the main page should display maximum 10 books, and add on the bottom of the page (1,2,3, Next) or something similar for the user to move to other pages [+]

Currently, the buttons appear visually detached from the rest of the card’s content. To make them look "contained" within the card, you need to ensure that the card layout and button container are structured and styled so that:

1. The card has a defined structure, possibly using a **footer area** for the buttons. [+]
2. The card’s internal layout (using flex or block-level elements) keeps content and buttons visually aligned and spaced. [+]

Below are some suggestions to improve the layout:

### Adjusting the Card Layout [+]

**Goal:** Make the buttons appear naturally at the bottom of the card, visually "contained" inside it. To achieve this:

- Wrap the buttons in a dedicated container (e.g., `.book-card-footer`). [+]
- Ensure the card is using a layout that places this footer area at the bottom. [+]

**Example HTML Structure:** [+]
```html
<div class="book-card">
  <div class="book-card-image">
    <!-- Placeholder image or cover image here -->
  </div>
  <div class="book-card-content">
    <!-- Title, author, rating, etc. -->
  </div>
  <div class="book-card-footer">
    <button class="btn btn-chat">
      <i class="icon-chat"></i> Chat
    </button>
    <button class="btn btn-download">
      <i class="icon-download"></i> Download
    </button>
  </div>
</div>
```

### Using Flexbox to Align Content [+]

If you want the entire card to stretch and the footer to always sit at the bottom of the card:

```css
.book-card {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  background: #fff; /* White background as specified */
  border: 1px solid #E2E8F0;
  border-radius: 4px;
  box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);
  padding: 16px; /* Add some padding around the content */
}

.book-card-image {
  flex: 0 0 auto;
  margin-bottom: 16px;
  text-align: center;
  /* Ensure cover image fits well: */
  img {
    width: 100%;
    object-fit: cover;
    aspect-ratio: 2/3; /* Helps maintain the 2:3 ratio if supported or use fixed height */
  }
}

.book-card-content {
  flex: 1 1 auto; 
  /* This will fill available space, pushing the footer down */
}

.book-card-footer {
  flex: 0 0 auto;
  display: flex;
  gap: 8px; /* space between buttons */
  margin-top: 16px; /* space above the footer section */
}
```

### Styling the Buttons [+]

You’ve chosen to simplify the text from "View & Chat" to just "Chat." The main goal now is to make these buttons look good and well-proportioned inside the card.

**Button Styling:** [+]
```css
.btn {
  background-color: #3182CE; /* Blue background */
  color: #fff; /* White text */
  font-size: 16px;
  padding: 10px 16px;
  border: none;
  border-radius: 4px;
  cursor: pointer;
  display: inline-flex; 
  align-items: center; /* Vertically center icon and text */
  gap: 8px; /* space between icon and text */
}

.btn:hover {
  background-color: #276C9B; /* Darker on hover */
}

.btn:focus {
  outline: 2px solid #3182CE;
  outline-offset: 2px;
}

/* Specific classes if needed */
.btn-chat::before {
  content: url('path/to/chat-icon.svg');
  /* Adjust if using icon fonts or inline SVG */
}

.btn-download::before {
  content: url('path/to/download-icon.svg');
}
```

If the icons appear too small, adjust their size. If you’re using icon fonts (like Font Awesome) instead of SVG:

```css
.btn .icon {
  font-size: 20px; /* Increase icon size to match text better */
  vertical-align: middle;
}
```

### Ensuring Buttons Are Clearly Within the Card [+]

- By placing the `.book-card-footer` inside the main `.book-card` container and using `flex-direction: column`, the footer naturally sits at the bottom, making buttons appear contained. [+]
- Adding a distinct background (e.g., slightly lighter than white or a top border) to the footer can also help visually separate it from the content above: [+]
  ```css
  .book-card-footer {
    border-top: 1px solid #E2E8F0; 
    padding-top: 12px;
  }
  ```

### Result [+]

After these changes:

- The buttons will appear inside the card, aligned at the bottom. [+]
- Adequate padding and a top border in the footer section help visually “contain” them. [+]
- The icons and text will be more balanced in size and spacing. [+]
- The card looks more polished, with buttons clearly associated with the card’s content. [+]

This updated approach ensures the “Chat” and “Download” buttons look like integral parts of each book card, improving both aesthetics and user experience. [+]



# Evaluation

1. **Star Rating Implementation:** [+] 
   Right now, all stars appear empty, and the numeric rating is separate. When implementing the star rating logic:
   - For a whole number rating (e.g., 4 stars), display four filled stars and one empty star if out of 5. [+] 
   - For fractional ratings (e.g., 4.5 or 4.7), you might use a half-star icon or a partially filled star for the fifth one. Ensure the icons reflect these states properly. [+]
   - Align the stars so they're on the same baseline as the numeric rating for a cleaner look. [+]

2. **Placeholder Image Position & Ratio:** [+] 
   The placeholder icon is displayed, but ensure that the `object-fit: cover` and aspect ratio settings are properly applied so that when a real cover image is loaded, it scales nicely. If the placeholder icon is too small or oddly positioned, consider making it a bit larger or centering it more clearly within its container for a more polished look. [+]

3. **Button Icons (If Desired):** [+] 
   If you're using icons next to the button text, ensure they're vertically centered and sized appropriately compared to the text. If you haven't included icons yet, consider small SVG icons that match the text size for a professional finish. [+]

4. **Subtle Visual Enhancements:** [+] 
   A light top border or subtle background tint in the footer section (where the buttons are) could help further differentiate it as a separate area of the card. This is optional but can help visually ground the buttons. [+]
