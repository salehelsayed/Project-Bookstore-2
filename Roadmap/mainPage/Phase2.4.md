### Addressing Fractional Star Ratings

**Current Setup from Provided Code:** [+]

- The HTML: [+]
  ```html
  <div class="book-rating">
      <div class="rating-stars" data-rating="{{ book.rating }}">
          <span class="star"></span>
          <span class="star"></span>
          <span class="star"></span>
          <span class="star"></span>
          <span class="star"></span>
      </div>
      <span class="rating">{{ "%.1f"|format(book.rating) }}</span>
      <span class="reviews">({{ book.reviews_count }} reviews)</span>
  </div>
  ```

**Improvements:**

1. **Ensure Overlapping of `::before` and `::after` is Correct:** [+]
   - Each `.star` has `::before` (gray star) and `::after` (yellow star).
   - Add `overflow: hidden;` to `.star` to ensure the partial fill stays within the star shape.
   ```css
   .star {
     overflow: hidden;
     position: relative;
     display: inline-block;
   }
   ```

2. **Check the Half-Star Icons:** [+]
   - The code uses a single full star icon and clips it to create partial stars. Ensure that the `::after` element is on top of `::before`:
     ```css
     .star::after {
       position: absolute;
       top: 0;
       left: 0;
       z-index: 1;
     }
     ```

3. **Adjust the JS Logic if Needed:** [+]
   - The JS logic is sound: it sets `fillPercentage = (rating % 1) * 100` for partial stars. Just make sure no rounding issues occur for certain decimals. If you see rounding issues, consider `toFixed(2)` when setting `fillPercentage`, though likely not necessary.

### Keeping the Rating and Reviews on One Line [+]

1. **White-Space and Container Size:** [+]
   - Add `white-space: nowrap;` to `.book-rating` to prevent the text from wrapping:
     ```css
     .book-rating {
       display: flex;
       align-items: center;
       gap: 8px;
       height: 24px;
       white-space: nowrap; /* Prevent line breaks */
     }
     ```

2. **Check Available Space:** [+]
   - If the card is too narrow and forcing a wrap, ensure the parent container is wide enough. If space is limited, reduce text size slightly or ensure responsive design allows space for `(1234 reviews)` to fit on one line.

3. **Font Sizes and Gaps:** [+]
   - `.rating` and `.reviews` have `font-size:14px;` which should be fine. Just ensure there are no hidden `<br>` tags or block-level elements inserted between rating and reviews that might force a line break.

### Improving Button Aesthetics [+]

1. **Consistent Button Styling:** [+]
   ```css
   .book-card-footer {
     display: flex;
     gap: 8px;
     padding-top: 12px; /* Add a top margin for breathing room */
   }

   .book-card-footer .btn {
     display: inline-flex;
     align-items: center;
     gap: 6px;
     background-color: #3182CE;
     color: #fff;
     font-size: 16px;
     padding: 8px 12px;
     border: none;
     border-radius: 4px;
     cursor: pointer;
     transition: background-color 0.2s ease;
     box-shadow: 0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);
   }
   ```

2. **Balancing Icon and Text:** [+]
   - If the icons appear small, increase their `font-size` or if using SVGs, set their `width` and `height`.
   - Ensure `.btn .icon` is vertically centered. If using `inline-flex` on `.btn`, they should naturally center. If not, add `vertical-align: middle;`.

3. **Visual Separation and Alignment:** [+]
   - The `.book-card-footer` could have a subtle top border to separate it from the content above:
     ```css
     .book-card-footer {
       border-top: 1px solid #E2E8F0;
       padding-top: 12px;
     }
     ```
   This visually indicates the footer area where buttons live, making them look more integrated and less "floating."

### Result After Adjustments [+]

- **Star Rating:** Fractional stars display correctly, with half (or partial) fill properly aligned inside each star. [+]
- **Rating & Reviews on One Line:** By using `white-space: nowrap;` and ensuring adequate width, the numeric rating and `(1234 reviews)` text remain on a single line. [+]
- **Buttons Aesthetics:** The "Chat" and "Download" buttons look more professional: properly padded, aligned icons, and styled backgrounds that match the card's overall look. [+]
