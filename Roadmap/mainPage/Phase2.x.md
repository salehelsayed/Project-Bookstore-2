1- In case the image of the coverpage doesn't exist, we should use a place holder
2- the star ratting of the review is a function that displays the number of starts , so if it's 5 stars all 5 stars should be yellow, if it is 4 stars, then 4 yellow stars and 1 empty star, if the rating has fraction ex, 4.7, then 4 stars yellow and the 5th star is half full with yellow. don't make it static, make a function that should be replicated in all book-cards (if you haven't implemented it yet".
3- the "Download" and "View & Chat" buttons should look better. 
4- the main page should display maximum 10 books, and add on the bottom of the page (1,2,3, Next) or something similar for the user to move to other pages

From the screenshot provided, it looks like the buttons are functional but not optimally sized, and the icons within them appear too small relative to the text and the card layout. Below are some guidelines you can apply as a follow-up (Phase 2.2) to enhance the UI:
