Below are detailed instructions for implementing the server-side approach in your current code. This method ensures that if the requested cover image file does not exist, the server will automatically provide a placeholder image path before the template is rendered, avoiding any 404 errors on the client side.

### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Identify Where to Insert the Logic:**  
   In your `main_routes.py`, after you’ve retrieved the `books` from the database (e.g., after `pagination = query.paginate(...)` and `books = pagination.items` in the `home()` route), you have a list of `Book` objects. This is the perfect place to verify that each book’s cover image file exists and, if not, set it to a placeholder image.

2. **Determine the Placeholder Image Path:**
   Ensure you have a placeholder image in `static/images/placeholder.png` (or another location of your choice). This placeholder will be used whenever the real cover image doesn’t exist.

3. **Check File Existence:**
   Use `os.path.isfile()` to check if the image file exists on the server. If not, replace `book.cover_path` with the path to the placeholder. Since your current `img` tag references `book.cover_path` using `url_for('static', filename=book.cover_path)`, just ensure that `book.cover_path` is relative to the `static` directory.

   For example, if your placeholder is at `app/static/images/placeholder.png`, then `book.cover_path` should be `'images/placeholder.png'`.

4. **Implementing the Logic in `home()` Route:**
   Here’s how you might modify the `home()` route:

   ```python
   @main.route('/')
   def home():
       """
       Display the homepage with initial book listing and filters.
       """
       # Initialize database if empty
       seed_database()

       # Get query parameters
       search_query = request.args.get('search', '').strip()
       page = request.args.get('page', 1, type=int)
       per_page = 12

       # Build query
       query = Book.query
       if search_query:
           query = query.filter(
               (Book.title.ilike(f'%{search_query}%')) |
               (Book.author.ilike(f'%{search_query}%'))
           )

       # Execute query with pagination
       pagination = query.paginate(page=page, per_page=per_page, error_out=False)
       books = pagination.items

       # Server-side check for cover images
       # Construct the absolute path to static directory
       # Adjust as needed based on your directory structure
       static_dir = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(__file__)), 'static')

       for book in books:
           if book.cover_path:
               # Construct full file path to the cover image
               cover_fullpath = os.path.join(static_dir, book.cover_path)
               if not os.path.isfile(cover_fullpath):
                   # If file doesn't exist, use placeholder
                   book.cover_path = 'images/placeholder.png'
           else:
               # If cover_path is not set at all, assign the placeholder
               book.cover_path = 'images/placeholder.png'

       return render_template('main.html',
                              books=books,
                              search_query=search_query,
                              current_page=page,
                              total_pages=pagination.pages)
   ```

   **What’s Happening Here:**
   - After retrieving `books`, we loop over each `book`.
   - For each book, we check if `book.cover_path` exists in the `static` directory.
   - If it doesn’t exist on the file system, we assign `book.cover_path = 'images/placeholder.png'`.

   When the template `main.html` is rendered, each `img` tag referencing `book.cover_path` will now point to an existing file. No front-end code changes are needed, and the user never sees a broken image.

5. **Verify the Changes:**
   - Make sure the placeholder image (`placeholder.png`) is located at `app/static/images/placeholder.png`.
   - Reload the page. Now, if a `cover_path` doesn’t exist or is incorrect, the placeholder image should appear instead of generating a 404 error.

### Additional Tips

- **Consistent Paths:**  
  Ensure that all `cover_path` values stored in the database are relative to the `static/` directory. For example, if a book’s cover is `static/storage/books/Architecture/arch_cover.png`, then `book.cover_path` should be `storage/books/Architecture/arch_cover.png`.

- **No Front-End Changes Required:**  
  By handling this on the server side, you don’t need to rely on `onerror` attributes in your HTML. The server logic ensures the template always receives a valid image path.

- **Performance Considerations:**  
  Checking file existence on every request is typically fine for smaller applications. For very large datasets, consider caching results or ensuring the file paths are correct at data ingestion time. But for this scenario, it’s straightforward and effective.
