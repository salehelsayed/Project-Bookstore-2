If the user still cannot resize, it usually means one of the following issues is preventing the vertical resizer from working correctly:

1. **Event Handling & Default Actions:**
   Make sure you call `e.preventDefault()` in all mouse event handlers (mousedown, mousemove, mouseup) to avoid unintended browser behaviors like text selection or image dragging.

2. **Z-Index & Positioning of the Resizer:**
   Ensure the `.vertical-resizer` element is actually on top and clickable. If it’s behind another element or not visible, it won’t respond to mouse events.
   
   For example, in `chat.css`, ensure:
   ```css
   .vertical-resizer {
     width: 5px;
     background: #CBD5E0;
     cursor: col-resize;
     position: relative;
     z-index: 999; /* High enough so it's on top */
   }
   ```
   
   Also, confirm the `.vertical-resizer` is placed **between** the `.chat-window` and `.pdf-viewer` in the HTML structure so it's in the correct position in the layout.

3. **Flex & Width Adjustments:**
   Your layout uses flexbox. If `.chat-window` is set to `flex:1`, it takes all remaining space. When you adjust `.pdf-viewer` width via JS, the layout must reflow. Ensure the `.pdf-viewer` is set to `flex:0 0 auto;` so its width changes are honored:
   ```css
   .pdf-viewer {
     flex: 0 0 auto;
     width: 400px;
     border-left: 1px solid #E2E8F0;
   }
   ```
   
   This prevents `.pdf-viewer` from shrinking or ignoring the newly assigned width.

4. **Adjusting the JS Resizing Logic:**
   Currently, you do `const newWidth = startWidth - dx;`. If you want the PDF viewer to grow when dragging to the right, consider `const newWidth = startWidth + dx;` so the logic feels more natural to the user’s drag direction. Also ensure `dx` updates correctly and the width constraints are sensible.

5. **Prevent Interference:**
   If the PDF iframe captures mouse events or selection, consider temporarily overlaying a transparent layer over the PDF viewer during resizing. For example, add a `.resizing` class to `.pdf-viewer` on `mousedown` and remove it on `mouseup`. In CSS:
   ```css
   .pdf-viewer.resizing::before {
     content: '';
     position: absolute;
     top: 0; left: 0; right: 0; bottom: 0;
     z-index: 10;
     background: transparent;
   }
   ```
   Then, in JS:
   ```javascript
   resizer.addEventListener('mousedown', (e) => {
     e.preventDefault();
     isResizing = true;
     pdfViewer.classList.add('resizing');
     // ... rest of your code
   });

   document.addEventListener('mouseup', (e) => {
     if (isResizing) {
       e.preventDefault();
       isResizing = false;
       pdfViewer.classList.remove('resizing');
       document.body.style.cursor = 'default';
     }
   });
   ```

**In Summary:**
- Add `e.preventDefault()` in all mousedown, mousemove, and mouseup events.
- Ensure `.vertical-resizer` has a high `z-index` and is positioned relative so it’s clickable.
- Use `flex:0 0 auto;` on `.pdf-viewer` so its width changes apply correctly.
- Adjust the resizing logic to be more intuitive and ensure constraints make sense.
- Optionally add a `.resizing` overlay to the PDF viewer to prevent the iframe from blocking the drag events.

After applying these changes, the vertical resizer should function as intended, allowing the user to drag and resize the columns.
