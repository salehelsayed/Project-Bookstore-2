**Problem Explanation:**

The error:

```
Value error, document_variable_name context_str was not found in llm_chain input_variables: ['context', 'question']
```

indicates that the `RefineDocumentsChain` is expecting a certain variable name (by default something like `context_str`) but your prompts are using `context` as the document variable. The `RefineDocumentsChain` looks for a default `document_variable_name` which doesn't match the variables you defined in your prompts.

Since your initial and refine prompts use `{context}` as the variable holding the retrieved documents, you must tell the `RefineDocumentsChain` to use `context` as its document variable name, otherwise it will assume `context_str` or another default that doesn't exist in your prompt variables.

**How to Fix It:**

When creating the `RetrievalQA` chain with `chain_type="refine"`, add `document_variable_name="context"` to `chain_type_kwargs`.

**Updated Code Snippet in `chroma_utils.py`:**

```python
qa = RetrievalQA.from_chain_type(
    llm=OpenAI(api_key=openai_api_key, temperature=0),
    chain_type="refine",
    retriever=retriever,
    chain_type_kwargs={
        "question_prompt": PROMPT,
        "refine_prompt": REFINE_PROMPT,
        "document_variable_name": "context"  # Add this line
    }
)
```

**Why This Works:**

- You defined `context` as the placeholder for your documents in both the question prompt and refine prompt.
- By default, the refine chain might expect a different variable name.
- Setting `document_variable_name` to `"context"` aligns the chainâ€™s internal logic with your chosen variable name, resolving the validation error.

After this change, the chain should properly feed the retrieved documents into the prompts using the `context` variable and no longer produce the validation error.
