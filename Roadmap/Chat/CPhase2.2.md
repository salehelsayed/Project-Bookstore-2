**Problem Identified:**

Currently, the `.chat-container` is absolutely positioned with `position: absolute; top:0; left:0; right:0; bottom:0;` and `height:100vh;`. This causes it to overlap or ignore the `nav` and `main` structure defined in `base.html`. The `nav` is pushing the `main` content down, but because `.chat-container` is absolutely positioned, it doesn’t respect the header’s space, effectively covering or hiding it behind itself.

You want the navigation bar (header) to remain visible at the top, and the chat container to appear directly beneath it, fully visible without scrolling. In other words, the `nav` should be at the top, followed by the `main` content (the chat), both visible in the viewport.

**How to Fix It:**

1. **Remove Absolute Positioning and 100vh from `.chat-container`:**  
   Instead of using absolute positioning and `height:100vh`, let the natural document flow place the `.chat-container` below the `nav`. Use flex properties to make `.chat-container` fill the remaining vertical space without overlapping the header.

2. **Leverage the Existing `base.html` Structure:**
   - `base.html` has a `nav` at the top and a `main` element afterward.
   - If the `nav` has a certain height, the `main` element’s content (the `.chat-container`) should occupy the rest of the viewport height minus the nav’s height.
   - Use `flex` on `body` or on `main` to create a column layout where `nav` occupies only the space it needs, and `main` (with `.chat-container`) expands to fill the remainder.

**Example CSS Changes:**

- In a global CSS file or in `base.html` within a `<style>` block, ensure:
  ```css
  html, body {
    height: 100%;
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
    overflow: hidden; /* If desired, prevent body-level scroll */
  }

  body {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
  }

  nav {
    flex: 0 0 auto;
    /* If nav has a set height, it will just use it. If not, it uses content height. */
  }

  main {
    flex: 1 1 auto; /* main takes the remaining space after nav */
    overflow: hidden; /* prevent scrolling at document level */
    display: flex; /* to allow inner elements to flex if needed */
    flex-direction: column; /* stack content inside main if needed */
  }
  ```

- Now remove `position: absolute;` and `height: 100vh;` from `.chat-container` in `chat.css`. Instead:
  ```css
  .chat-container {
    display: flex;
    width: 100%;
    background-color: #f0f2f5;
    overflow: hidden;
    user-select: none;
    /* Remove position:absolute; and top/left/right/bottom and height:100vh */
    flex: 1; /* let it grow to fill available space in main */
  }
  ```

With this approach:
- The `nav` at the top takes up its natural space.
- `main` below it is `flex:1`, so it expands to fill the remaining viewport space.
- `.chat-container` inside `main` also uses `flex:1` (or just `.chat-container` as the only child of `main` can fill it by default), making it fit the available space beneath the `nav`.
- No extra scrolling at the top level is needed because `.messages` and `.chat-input` handle internal scrolling as necessary.

**In Summary:**
- Do not rely on `position:absolute` and `height:100vh` for `.chat-container`.
- Instead, rely on the natural document flow and flex layout from `nav` to `main` to `.chat-container`.
- This ensures the header remains visible on top and the chat fits below without overlapping or requiring the user to scroll the entire window.
